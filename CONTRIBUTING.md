# Contributing Pull Requests (TEST PATCH)

We use a Draft Pull Request workflow to manage contributions effectively.

This tab is the central space for communication to see what peers are working on.

# Choosing an issue to work on

1. Pick and issue from the [Issues tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/issues), consider using a suitable filter like [good first issue](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22good%20first%20issue%22). (See also [CONTRIBUTING_issues_tab.md](/CONTRIBUTING_issues_tab.md))
2. Check the [Pull Requests Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/pulls).

# What to include before completing a pull request

1. pull from `main` branch to ensure no merge conflicts between `branch` and `main`
2. run `cd frontend; npm run build` causing no typescript errors
3. include # in description e.g. #243. This links the pull request to issue(s) solved
4. add **screenshots and or screen recordings** of the new outcome

Optional: to request the code owner team to manually test the branch in their IDE, you can add the label `action required: manual testing`

template provided [here](/pull_request_template.md).

# Roles

- Everyone is a contributor.
- The Code owners have the additional role to review + merge the pull requests.

# Frequently asked Questions

Q: How do I get assigned to an issue?
A: The best way to self-assign is by drafting a Pull Request. Just check the [Pull Requests Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/pulls) for potential overlap.

Q: I want to work on an issue. Is it acceptable to pull request an initial commit with no changes?
A: Yes! Just make sure it is marked as `draft`.

Q: I want to work on an issue but someone has started working on it in the Pull Request drafts.
A: If someone has started on the [Pull Requests Tab](https://github.com/lmcrean/dottie/pulls), consider reaching out to that peer in the comments and offering to contribute an isolated issue to their branch.
