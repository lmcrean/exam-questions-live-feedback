Add missing /api/chat/:chatId/message/initial route

- Create send-initial-message controller and route
- Handle POST /api/chat/:chatId/message/initial endpoint
- Fix 404 error when frontend sends initial message to conversation
- Route extracts chatId from URL params and passes to sendMessageFlow

Resolves the "Cannot POST /api/chat/{id}/message/initial" error reported in frontend logs.
